## Abstract

Chances are, most of us are primarily writing in Object Oriented Languages. But how many of us are truly doing Object Oriented Programming (OOP)? Objects are a powerful abstraction, but when all we do is write procedural code wrapped in classes we’re not realizing their benefits. That’s the tricky thing about OO, it’s easy to have Objects but still not be doing good OOP. This has led to a plethora of principles and patterns and laws, which are very valuable, but also easy to misunderstand and misapply. In this talk we’ll go back to the foundations of Objects, and take a careful look at what OO is really about and how our principles and patterns fit into the big picture. We’ll see why good OOP is important, and look at the mindset needed to design successful Objects. When we’re done, we’ll have a more nuanced understanding of what good OO is, what it can do for us, and when we should use it.
